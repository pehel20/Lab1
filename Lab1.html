  HTML, which stands for <em><mark>HyperText Markup Language</mark></em>, is the standard language used to design and structure web pages. It helps organize content such as <u>text, images, videos, links, and more</u> so that web browsers can display them correctly. HTML works by using</i> predefined </i>keywords called <b>elements</b> , which help define the purpose and format of different parts of a web page. Every website on the internet uses HTML in some form, and it acts as the foundation on which web content is built.
</p>
<p>
HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it describes how content should appear on a page. With the release of newer versions like <i><mark>HTML5</mark></i>, many new features have been added to make websites more interactive and user-friendly. These include support for <u>audio, video, graphics, and better structuring of web content</u>. HTML also plays a key role in how <b>search engines</b> understand the content of a web page and how accessible it is to users with different needs.
